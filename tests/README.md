# Unit Testing

Unit testing in the context of a WordPress plugin requires some additional setup.

The concern is to have a local WordPress testing instance so PHPunit has access to the API. Otherwise, any calls to WP methods would fail.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/#installing) installed.



## Setup

```sh
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root password localhost latest
```

```sh
$: cd ~/wp-form-validation/
$: bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root root 127.0.0.1:5555 latest true
```

**SSH Tunnel to VM**
```sh
ssh -N -L 5555:127.0.0.1:3306 remoteuser@remotedomain.com -vv
```
```sh
$: ssh -N -L 5555:127.0.0.1:3306 vagrant@192.168.33.10 -vv
```
