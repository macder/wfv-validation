WFV is an elegant way to work with custom forms in WordPress.

A simple fluid and concise API to manage user input, validation, feedback, and safe output.

**User documentation available at [https://macder.github.io/wfv/](https://macder.github.io/wfv/)**

WFV is intended for developers who prefer creating and managing forms at the code level. This is not a WYSIWYG type plugin and is not targeted for users who are not comfortable writing code.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome and encouraged. Before contributing a new feature or fix, please check the [issues](https://github.com/macder/wfv-validation/issues) section (open and closed) to make sure no one is already working on what you intend.

* If there is no open or closed issue, open a new issue so that others know you are working on something.
* If an issue is already open, you may be able to help. Make a comment in the issue that you intend to help out. If no one is working on the issue, it will be assigned to you, otherwise ask if they require help. Please use a common sense approach
* If you require help or you stop working on an issue before it is complete, make a comment about it. Please do not hijack an issue by abandoning it without telling anyone.

### Workflow

WFV follows the Gitflow Workflow. If you are not familiar with it, please read [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow)


## Testing

**NOTE: This section may be slightly outdated and will be updated ASAP**

### Prerequisites

A working [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org) install.

Install PHPunit dependency by running `bin/lib/install_phpunit.sh`.

This will `composer require` the correct package for your local PHP version. The install is isolated to the project.


### Interactive Setup
The easiest way to get setup and test is using the interactive bash script `bin/start_tests`

It's menu driven, with the hope of making more of the process self explanatory.

**1) Set Local Parameters**

Rename `bin/tests_sample.conf` to `bin/tests.conf`, then open with an editor.

Set your local parameters, you know the drill.

**2) Start**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# From plugin root:
$: cd bin
$: ./start_tests

```
```sh
--------------------------------
 W F V   U N I T  T E S T I N G
--------------------------------
 MAIN MENU
--------------------------------

  1. SSH Tunnel For Remote DB
  2. Start WordPress Testing Instance
  3. Run Tests

  4. Exit

Enter choice [ 1 - 4 ]

```

**1. SSH Tunnel:**<br>
Starts SSH tunnel to a remote DB host. If your DB is local, you don't need this.

**2. Start wp-tests Instance**<br>
Creates and starts the wp-tests instance.

**3.Run Tests**
```sh

 UNIT TESTS

  3. Inspection Agent
  4. Director
  5. Form Artisan
  6. Error Collection
  7. Input Collection
  8. Message Collection
  9. Rule Collection
  10. Form Composite

  11. Exit

Enter choice [ 1 - 11 ]

```

**Skip Main Menu**
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Open testing menu
$: ./start_tests test

```

### Manual Setup
The nuts and bolts of what `./start_tests` is doing

**Create the testing instance**

If database is local:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# From plugin root
$: bash bin/lib/install_wp_tests.sh wordpress_test db_user db_pass localhost latest
```

If database is remote (Docker, Vagrant, VM) open a SSH tunnel:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# e.g. from local:

$: ssh -N -L 5555:127.0.0.1:3306 vagrant@192.168.33.10 -vv
```

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Then, in a new local terminal:

$: cd ~/wfv-validation/
$: bash bin/lib/install_wp_tests.sh wordpress_test db_user db_pass 127.0.0.1:5555 latest true
```
